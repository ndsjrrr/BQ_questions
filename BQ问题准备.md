# BQ问题准备

1 proud project



2 tight ddl



3 critical feedback



4 help others 



5 decide incomplete with data 



6 learn new things 



7 Customer Obsession



8 make a mistake





## Disagreement with others

1 核心观点：冲突 - 坚持自己的看法 / 妥协 - 行动过程 - 最终结果

- Have a backbone / Disagree and Commit 
  - 围绕 坚持 - 冲突 - 妥协
- Earn Trust 
  - 沟通 - 化解分歧 - 让对方相信你的想法
- Are Right, A Lot
  - 如果过程中涉及到你的抉择，判断，复盘

#### Situation:

我的看法：多做一点优化

他的看法：Quick finish 不做优化



#### Task：

我想学习更多，而不是简单把事情做完。

我需要convince 他这些optimization是值得extra effort的。



#### Actions：

1 Open discussion

- Had a conversation with teammates, to fully understand her concern. Time is important

2 Data-driven Explanation:

- Expressed my view about the project, want to make the system better and closer to the actual industry environment so the work is meaningful. 
- Also shared some of my examples from my previous git status, showcasing that the change and optimization can improve the performance!

3 Proposing a Compromise:

- Banalacing our priorities, only optimize the part that are practical and easy to optimize without spending a lot of time rewrting the whole features again.
- Decouple the code using a message queue. 
- For the other part, we can optimize them later



#### Results:

After reaching a agreement, I quickly implement the changes. The optimization took us about 2 days, which did not affect our progress too much.

The decoupled process improve the overall system realiability and both my teammate and I were satisfied with this outcome. We did not affect our plan too much, and we also enhanced our system scalability.



优化的地方：

developed an individual coding sandbox, decouple workflow....

没有优化的：

some other more classes that might affect the system performances.
